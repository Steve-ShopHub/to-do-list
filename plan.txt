    - List category

    - Position?*
    - 

Project lists

    - To do (default)
    - Doing
    - Done

    Users need to be able to choose


Set up save & load functions
    Function save
        - Save projects and to-dos to local storage whenever a new project or to-do is created

    Function load
        - looks for that data in localStorage when your app is first loaded.

    Make sure your app doesn’t crash if the data you may want retrieve from localStorage isn’t there!




Separate application logic (creating new to-do's, setting to-do's as complete etc) SEPARATE from DOM-related stuff

            **Keep all these things in separate modules**


UI
    - view all projects

    - view all todos in each project (probably just the title and duedate… perhaps changing color for different priorities)

    - expand a single todo to see/edit its details

    - delete a todo


    - draggable to-do's?
